## Transparent strategy platform from PhP memorial Fund

Always day 1 in the new metaverse world, so be open, connect, learn and share.

Money/Moon is just a by-product, it is not the goal and one day you will realise not as important as other valuable things

This repo will be a resource collector that you can use: whether a 10 year old student or a 70 yo man.

Reliable, simple to follow.

We acknowledge: not everything will be 100% reliable, so we make evaluation, save minimal and most important things, then make trade-off as needed

we make things scalable.

### Example of how to choose a notes-taking tool:

Notion beats Evernote/Onenote by the way it meshes up meta paragraphs, it is not open source but it is free, so for non-confidential use it is sufficiently good, we don't need Roam in most cases.


### Initial Investment: 

30% in ETH/Stablecoin pair liquidity pool (Uni v3), this is essentially'buying the dip and sell the rise', for example when range of $2k-$5k is chosen, then when price drops to $1999 then I will own only ETH and all USDC are auto-sold along the way , and vice versa, if Eth raise to $4800 then almost all ETH were sold to the pool drainer.

20% in a high grow pair with high volume/TVL rationbeing UNI/ETH

20% in BTC,10% ETH

20% in higher risk investment + arbitrage: IDO (hedged risk (borrow 100 Ray to get cheap acceleraytor tokens), develop automated-trading to pick Fwb (~400%),Karma( loss of capital) Bunny (300%-800%)/Autoshark (95% loss of capital), airdrop, register ENS name/ hire deve to get HNS name

team building/community cultivating, ideally IDO, gitcoin grants, direct funding etc

 Learn a little philosophy may help, for example: for users in developed countries/regions, your resource can give you more time; for users with limited capitl, your time can be your resource - so we can unit.
