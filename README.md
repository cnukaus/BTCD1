## Transparent strategy platform from PhP memorial Fund

Always day 1 in the new metaverse world, so be open, connect, learn and share.

Money/Moon is just a by-product, it is not the goal and one day you will realise not as important as other valuable things

This repo will contain quant methods to evaluate crypto yield strategies, and we hope it is simple enough that a 10 year old student or a 70 yo man can use it.

Reliable, simple to follow.

We acknowledge: not everything will be 100% reliable, so we make evaluation, save minimal and most important things, then make trade-off as needed

we make things scalable. We use available tools but do not hesitate to modify/build own tool.

Example of how to choose a notes-taking tool:

Notion beats Evernote/Onenote by the way its flexible management of meta paragraphs, not open source but free and easy to export, so for non-confidential use, it is sufficient and we don't need Roam.


### Initial Investment: 

30% in ETH/Stablecoin pair liquidity pool (Uni v3), this is essentially'buying the dip and sell the rise', for example when range of $2k-$5k is chosen, then when price drops to $1999 then I will own only ETH and all USDC are auto-sold along the way , and vice versa, if Eth raise to $4800 then almost all ETH were sold to the pool drainer.

20% in a high grow pair with high volume/TVL rationbeing UNI/ETH

20% in BTC,10% ETH

20% in higher risk investment + arbitrage: IDO (hedged risk (borrow 100 Ray to get cheap acceleraytor tokens), develop automated-trading to pick Fwb (~400%),Karma( loss of capital) Bunny (300%-800%)/Autoshark (95% loss of capital), staking data on OceanProtocol, register ENS name/ hire deve to get HNS name

team building/community cultivating, ideally IDO, gitcoin grants, direct funding etc

 Learn a little philosophy may help, for example: for users in developed countries/regions, your resource can give you more time; for users with limited capitl, your time can be your resource - so we can unit.

## Use previous data to back test

## Using Ocean Protocol to back test other strategies contributed by future contributors 

## reward contributors with Poap

## Qualitative research that can be semi-automated to assess future performance

F.A.Q

Why you open source the strategy?

A:
Because we are rugging the fiat, so if we stay together our action is more robust (and lower risk)
