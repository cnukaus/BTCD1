### Feature hierarchy:


[feature_source].[feature_set].[feature_name]

examples:

"[gitcoin.co](http://gitcoin.co/)"."user_sybil"."sybil_likelihood"

"[api.github.com](http://api.github.com/)"."reputation"."followers"

"manual_googlesheets"."joe"."favouriteicons_count"


### Selection criteria:


1. Coverage: data fields  covering a significant amount of users are prefered

sparse features require more preparation effort to be useful, it is possible to include, maybe sometimes consider to derive/pca/merge sparse ones

2. Battle-tested: Used in previous GR rounds

3. Subject Matter Experts

4. Industry anti-spam resources (curated list, blacklist, IP addresses)

5. based on data source list (asked for it from dao members)
