# Medium Term Goals

With the following conceptual model in mind, we can build:

- [ ]  Transparent data for all - Sybil score of each user showing on website - the function was available publicly according to Disruption Joe
- [ ]  Data Catalogue
- [ ]  An active community that build their own dashboards separately- based on on-chain or shared data by Gitcoin. examples: various Bitcoin dashboards
- [ ]  Recurring review of data priorities - what to delete, what to retain, what to ingest, what pipeline

Google updating privacy data terms (the new versions of theÂ Standard Contractual Clauses under GDPR).

EU work below discussed data portal base on source code porotal, 2 modes for dataset owners and re-users, prototype implemented on [gitea.io](http://gitea.io/), okay for a 3 minutes read 

That's why Ocean protocol, [swash](https://swashapp.io/referral/23177) is worth further test, money is data, data is money
